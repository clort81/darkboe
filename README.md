Dark Blades of Exile
=======================

This project hosts Clort's remastered graphics version of Open Blades of Exile 

All colors have been changed. All fonts have been changed, and most graphics 
assets have been changed to 'No More Tears' versions.

The work is in progress and is being hosted on GitHub to help prevent data loss.

It should build cleanly on linux, possibly windows and mac as well.

Changes to functional code are minor to non-existent. I hope someday a Dark BoE option
can be added to the main oBoE/cBoE tree.
