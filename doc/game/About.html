<h1>About Blades of Exile</h1>
<h2 id='this'>About this copy</h2>
<p>This is Blades of Exile, a huge, highly-detailed fantasy role-playing system for the
PC. This remarkable set of programs contains nearly infinite possibilities for adventure.
First, the game itself comes with three full, exciting scenarios, filled with excitement,
puzzles, and role-playing. Then there is the Blades of Exile scenario editor, which you
can use to make your own role-playing adventures to play yourself or trade with friends.
Finally, you can obtain scenarios which other people have made with the scenario editor
and play through them yourself. Even when you've finished the scenarios that come with
Blades, you've only started to tap the potential for fun this product offers you!</p>
<p>In 2007, ten years after the original release of BoE, the source code of the game was
released, and the tedious process of updating the game to modern standards began.</p>
<p>This copy should, when you first receive it, contain a copy of the game, data
files, four scenarios, and two utility programs (the character editor and the scenario
editor).</p>

<h2 id='sysreq'>System Requirements</h2>
<p>Blades of Exile should work on most modern computers, as its requirements were
originally for old Classic Macs and Windows 3.x. The modern, updated version requires Mac
OSX 10.7 (it may or may not work on earlier version) or Windows 7 (it may work on Vista
but probably won't work on XP).</p>
<p>It will run on Linux under WINE, provided you have at least version 1.7.31. There is
currently no native Linux version.</p>
